THE TUBE IS SHAKEN, THE REACTION ALLOWED TO SETTLE AND 4.5 ML OF HCI IS ADDED. THE TUBE IS SHAKEN AGAIN AND THE SOLUTION ALLOWED TO SETTLE OVERNIGHT. NEXT DAY, THE SAMPLE TUBE IS PLACED ON A HOT BLOCK DIGESTION SYSTEM AND ALLOWED TO SIT FOR ONE HOUR AT 60o C. IT IS RAMPED FROM 60o C TO 80o C. THE UNIT IS SET UP FOR A RAMP TIME OF ONE HOUR. IT IS THEN RAMPED FROM 80o C TO 100o C. THIS SHOULD TAKE AN ADDITIONAL HOUR. THE SAMPLE IS THEN ALLOWED TO DIGEST AT 100o C FOR 4 HOURS. SAMPLES THAT HAVE REACHED NEAR DRYNESS, APPROXIMATELY 1 ML OF DIGEST, ARE REMOVED FROM THE HOT BLOCK. IF THE SAMPLE IS NOT AT NEAR DRYNESS, THE TEMPERATURE IS RAMPLED TO 120 o C AND THE SAMPLES ARE REMOVED AS THEY REACH NEAR DRYNESS. THE COMBINATION OF TEMPERATURE AND THE STRONG OXIDIZING CONDITIONS ENSURES DESTRUCTION OF THE ORGANIC AND INORGANIC COMPONENTS OF THE SUBSTRATE. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF SILICEOUS BOUND ELEMENTS, THE AQUA-REGIA DIGESTION PROVIDES EFFECTIVE EXTRACTION OF ANALYTES OF INTEREST. THE DIGEST IS ALLOWED TO COOL OVERNIGHT.

THE TUBE IS SHAKEN, THE REACTION ALLOWED TO SETTLE AND 4.5 ML OF HCI IS ADDED. THE TUBE IS SHAKEN AGAIN AND THE SOLUTION ALLOWED TO SETTLE OVERNIGHT. NEXT DAY, THE SAMPLE TUBE IS PLACED ON A HOT BLOCK DIGESTION SYSTEM AND ALLOWED TO SIT FOR ONE HOUR AT 60o C. IT IS RAMPED FROM 60o C TO 80o C. THE UNIT IS SET UP FOR A RAMP TIME OF ONE HOUR. IT IS THEN RAMPED FROM 80o C TO 100o C. THIS SHOULD TAKE AN ADDITIONAL HOUR. THE SAMPLE IS THEN ALLOWED TO DIGEST AT 100o C FOR 4 HOURS. SAMPLES THAT HAVE REACHED NEAR DRYNESS, APPROXIMATELY 1 ML OF DIGEST, ARE REMOVED FROM THE HOT BLOCK.

THE COMBINATION OF TEMPERATURE AND THE STRONG OXIDIZING CONDITIONS ENSURES DESTRUCTION OF THE ORGANIC AND INORGANIC COMPONENTS OF THE SUBSTRATE. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF SILICEOUS BOUND ELEMENTS, THE AQUA-REGIA DIGESTION PROVIDES EFFECTIVE EXTRACTION OF ANALYTES OF INTEREST. THE DIGEST IS ALLOWED TO COOL OVERNIGHT.

THERE IS NO DESTRUCTION OF SILICATES. THE PROCEDURE IS, AS FOLLOWS: ONE-HALF GRAM OF HOMOGENEOUS FREEZE-DRIED SEDIMENT IS WEIGHED INTO A TEFLON (PFA) 60 ML DIGESTION TUBE AND 1.5 ML OF NITRIC ACID IS ADDED. THE TUBE IS SHAKEN, THE REACTION ALLOWED TO SETTLE AND 4.5 ML OF HCI IS ADDED. THE TUBE IS SHAKEN AGAIN AND THE SOLUTION ALLOWED TO SETTLE OVERNIGHT. NEXT DAY, THE SAMPLE TUBE IS PLACED ON A HOT BLOCK DIGESTION SYSTEM AND ALLOWED TO SIT FOR ONE HOUR AT 60o C. IT IS RAMPED FROM 60o C TO 80o C. THE UNIT IS SET UP FOR A RAMP TIME OF ONE HOUR. IT IS THEN RAMPED FROM 80o C TO 100o C. THIS SHOULD TAKE AN ADDITIONAL HOUR. THE SAMPLE IS THEN ALLOWED TO DIGEST AT 100o C FOR 4 HOURS. SAMPLES THAT HAVE REACHED NEAR DRYNESS, APPROXIMATELY 1 ML OF DIGEST, ARE REMOVED FROM THE HOT BLOCK. IF THE SAMPLE IS NOT AT NEAR DRYNESS, THE TEMPERATURE IS RAMPLED TO 120 o C AND THE SAMPLES ARE REMOVED AS THEY REACH NEAR DRYNESS. THE COMBINATION OF TEMPERATURE AND THE STRONG OXIDIZING CONDITIONS ENSURES DESTRUCTION OF THE ORGANIC AND INORGANIC COMPONENTS OF THE SUBSTRATE. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF SILICEOUS BOUND ELEMENTS, THE AQUA-REGIA DIGESTION PROVIDES EFFECTIVE EXTRACTION OF ANALYTES OF INTEREST. THE DIGEST IS ALLOWED TO COOL OVERNIGHT. IT IS DILUTED TO 100 ML WITH REAGENT WATER AND PLACED IN A TEFLON (PFA) BOTTLE. THE FOLLOWING DAY, THE SOLUTION IS DECANTED INTO A 60 ML HDPE BOTTLE.
